I created an application that calculates grades based on the Desire 2 Learn grading framework and user interface. I did this by utilizing the Agile software design process. 
Through this design process, I created a requirements specification and a design specification. However, when I began coding, I realized I needed to make some changes to the specifications I had previously created. So, an updated document that reflects the finished product rather than the conceptual model is included within this repository along with the Grade Getter source code. This document only includes parts of the original specifications that needed to be updated, so assume the original specifications were used if an update isn't provided.
